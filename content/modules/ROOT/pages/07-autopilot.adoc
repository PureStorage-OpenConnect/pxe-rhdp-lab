= Lab 07 - PVC Auto Resize using AutoPilot

== Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create and manage automatic volume resizing for a PostgreSQL Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) using Portworx AutoPilot. We will begin by creating a StorageClass and a PVC for PostgreSQL that allows volume expansion. After that, we will deploy a PostgreSQL instance that uses this PVC. Finally, we will configure an AutoPilot rule to automatically resize the volume when a certain usage threshold is reached, ensuring seamless expansion without downtime.

== Create StorageClass and PersistentVolumeClaim

Take a look at the StorageClass definition for Portworx:

[source,shell]
----
oc delete sc px-repl3-sc
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: px-repl3-sc
provisioner: pxd.portworx.com
parameters:
  repl: "3"
  io_profile: "db"
  priority_io: "high"
allowVolumeExpansion: true
EOF
----

The parameters are declarative policies for your storage volume. Notice the `allowVolumeExpansion: true`; this is necessary for OpenShift volume expansion. See https://docs.portworx.com/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/storage-operations/create-pvcs/dynamic-provisioning/[here] for a full list of supported parameters.

We also need to apply a ConfigMap to allow OpenShift's Prometheus instance to monitor Portworx events.

[NOTE]
====
During the next test phase, omit this ConfigMap and wait 15 minutes after the pgbench command to ensure it is needed.
====

[source,shell]
----
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    enableUserWorkload: true
EOF
----

Create a new PersistentVolumeClaim:

[source,shell]
----
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: px-postgres-pvc
  labels:
    app: postgres
spec:
  storageClassName: px-repl3-sc
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
EOF
----

This defines the initial volume size. Portworx will thin provision the volume.

== Create Secret for PostgreSQL

Create a Secret to store the PostgreSQL password.

[source,shell]
----
echo -n mysql123 > /tmp/password.txt
oc create secret generic postgres-pass --from-file=/tmp/password.txt
----

== Deploy PostgreSQL

Now that we have the volumes created, letâ€™s deploy PostgreSQL!

[source,shell]
----
cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: postgres
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: postgres
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 1
    type: RollingUpdate
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: postgres
    spec:
      schedulerName: stork
      containers:
      - name: postgres
        image: postgres:9.5
        imagePullPolicy: "IfNotPresent"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 5432
        env:
        - name: POSTGRES_USER
          value: pgbench
        - name: PGUSER
          value: pgbench
        - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: postgres-pass
              key: password.txt
        - name: PGBENCH_PASSWORD
          value: superpostgres
        - name: PGDATA
          value: /var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data
          name: postgredb
      volumes:
      - name: postgredb
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: px-postgres-pvc
EOF
----

Observe the `volumeMounts` and `volumes` sections where we mount the PVC.

== Verify PostgreSQL Pod is Ready

Below command will wait until the PostgreSQL pod is in the ready state.

[source,shell]
----
watch oc get pods -l app=postgres -o wide
----

When the pod is in the Running state, hit `ctrl-c` to exit.

== Inspect the Portworx Volume

Below we will use `pxctl` to inspect the underlying volume for our PVC.

[source,shell]
----
pxctl volume inspect $(oc get pvc | grep px-postgres-pvc | awk '{print $3}')
----

* `State`: Indicates that the volume is attached and shows the node on which it is attached. This is the node where the Kubernetes pod is running.
* `HA`: Displays the number of configured replicas for this volume.
* `Labels`: Shows the name of the PVC associated with this volume.
* `Replica sets on nodes`: Displays the Portworx (px) nodes on which the volume is replicated.
* `Size`: The size of the volume is 1GB. We'll check this later to verify if the volume has been expanded.

== Configure AutoPilot Rule

Now that we have PostgreSQL up, let's proceed to set up our AutoPilot rule!

Learn more about https://2.11.docs.portworx.com/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/autopilot/how-to-use/working-with-rules/#understanding-an-autopilotrule[working with AutoPilot Rules] in the Portworx documentation.

Keep in mind, an AutoPilot Rule has 4 main parts:

* `Selector`: Matches labels on the objects that the rule should monitor.
* `Namespace Selector`: Matches labels on the Kubernetes namespaces the rule should monitor. This is optional, and the default is all namespaces.
* `Conditions`: The metrics for the objects to monitor.
* `Actions`: The actions to perform once the metric conditions are met.

Below we target the PostgreSQL PVC using an AutoPilot Rule.

[source,shell]
----
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: autopilot.libopenstorage.org/v1alpha1
kind: AutopilotRule
metadata:
  name: auto-volume-resize
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: postgres
  conditions:
    expressions:
    - key: "100 * (px_volume_usage_bytes / px_volume_capacity_bytes)"
      operator: Gt
      values:
        - "20"
    - key: "px_volume_capacity_bytes / 1000000000"
      operator: Lt
      values:
       - "20"
  actions:
  - name: openstorage.io.action.volume/resize
    params:
      scalepercentage: "200"
EOF
----

The `condition` and `action` in the rule are defined such that when the volume is using more than `20%` of its total available capacity, it will grow the volume by `200%`. Normally, you would use a larger threshold for volume usage.

== Verify AutoPilot Initialization

[source,shell]
----
watch oc get events --field-selector involvedObject.kind=AutopilotRule,involvedObject.name=auto-volume-resize --all-namespaces
----

Check that AutoPilot has recognized the PVC and initialized it. When the events show `transition from Initializing => Normal` for the PostgreSQL PVC, AutoPilot is ready. Hit `ctrl-c` to exit.

== Run Benchmark and Verify Volume Expansion

In this step, we will run a benchmark that uses more than 20% of our volume and show how AutoPilot dynamically increases the volume size without downtime or user intervention.

Open a shell inside the PostgreSQL container:

[source,shell]
----
oc exec -it $(oc get pods -l app=postgres --field-selector=status.phase=Running -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -- bash

----

Launch the `psql` utility and create a database:

[source,shell]
----
psql
create database pxdemo;
\l
\q
----

Use `pgbench` to run a baseline transaction benchmark to grow the volume beyond the 20% threshold defined in the AutoPilot Rule:

[source,shell]
----
pgbench -i -s 50 pxdemo
----

[NOTE]
====
Note that once the test completes, *AutoPilot will ensure the usage remains above 20% for about 30 seconds before triggering the rule.* Type `exit` to exit from the pod shell before proceeding.
====

== Check if the Rule Was Triggered

We can retrieve events by using the `oc get events` command and filtering for `AutoPilotRule` events. Note that AutoPilot delays the rule from being triggered immediately to ensure the conditions stabilize.

[source,shell]
----
watch oc get events --field-selector involvedObject.kind=AutopilotRule,involvedObject.name=auto-volume-resize --all-namespaces
----

When you see `Triggered => ActiveActionsPending`, the action has been activated. When you see `ActiveActionsInProgress => ActiveActionsTake`, this means the resize has taken place and your volume should now be resized by *200%*. Hit `ctrl-c` to clear the screen.

Inspect the volume and verify that it has grown by 200% capacity (3GB).

[source,shell]
----
oc get pvc px-postgres-pvc
----

As you can see, the volume is now expanded and our PostgreSQL database didn't require a restart.

[source,shell]
----
oc get pods
----

== Manual Resize of PVC

It is also possible to manually resize a PVC. Below we will resize the volume to 4GiB.

Edit the existing PVC and change the size to 4GiB:

[source,shell]
----
oc edit pvc px-postgres-pvc
----

Check the utilization of the volume after the resize. It takes approximately 30 seconds to complete resizing.

[source,shell]
----
oc describe pvc px-postgres-pvc
----

You can see events that indicate the PVC was successfully resized and that the volume is now 4GiB.

== Summary

In this lab, we demonstrated how to create and manage automatic volume resizing for a PostgreSQL PVC using Portworx AutoPilot. We created a StorageClass and a PVC that allowed volume expansion, deployed a PostgreSQL instance, and set up an AutoPilot rule to automatically resize the volume when a specific threshold was met. We also verified the rule's functionality by running a benchmark that triggered the volume expansion. Additionally, we manually resized the PVC to show both automatic and manual expansion capabilities. This ensures that our PostgreSQL deployment can handle increasing storage demands seamlessly, without downtime or manual intervention.
