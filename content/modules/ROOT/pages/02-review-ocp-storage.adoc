= Lab 02 - Understanding OpenShift Storage

In this step, we will create a StorageClass for Portworx volumes.

== Understanding StorageClass

A
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/storage/dynamic-provisioning.html[StorageClass]
provides a way for administrators to describe the “classes” of storage
on their OpenShift cluster. Before we create a volume in OpenShift, we
have to create a StorageClass.

For example, the following is a Portworx StorageClass whose volumes have
replication factor of 3 and high IO priority. * Replication factor of 3
means the data for the volume is replicated on 3 different nodes in the
cluster * High IO priority means Portworx will use storage devices that
are classified into the high IO profile (for e.g SSDs).

Create the storage class by running

[source,shell]
----
cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: px-repl3-sc
provisioner: pxd.portworx.com
parameters:
  repl: "3"
  priority_io: "high"
reclaimPolicy: Delete
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
EOF
----

Let's proceed to creating volumes that use this storage class.

In this step, we will deploy a `PersistentVolumeClaim` using Portworx.

== Understand PersistentVolumeClaim

A
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/storage/understanding-persistent-storage.html[PersistentVolumeClaim]
can be used to dynamically create a volume using Portworx.

For example, below is the spec for a 2GB volume that uses the Portworx
Storage class we created previously.

Let's create the PersistentVolumeClaim:

[source,shell]
----
cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: px-pvc
spec:
  storageClassName: px-repl3-sc
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 2Gi
EOF
----

Behind the scenes, OpenShift talks to the Portworx native driver to create this PVC. Each PVC has a unique one-one mapping a PersistentVolume, which is the actual volume backing the PVC.

== Validate PersistentVolumeClaim

A PersistentVolumeClaim is successfully provisioned once it is in the 
“Bound” state. Let's run the below script to check that.

[source,shell]
----
oc get pvc
----

we can see in the example output that our PVC is bound.

Let's proceed to the next step to further inspect the volume.

In this step, we will use `pxctl` to inspect the volume.

== Inspect the Portworx volume

Below we will use pxctl to inspect the underlying volume for our PVC.

[source,shell]
----
VOL=$(oc get pvc | grep px-pvc | awk '{print $3}')
pxctl volume inspect ${VOL}
----

Make the following observations in the inspect output * `HA` shows the
number of configured replcas for this volume * `Labels` show the name of
the PVC for this volume * `Replica sets on nodes` shows the px nodes on
which volume is replicated * `State` indicates the volume is detached
which means no applications are using the volume yet
